# NightVisionHelmet Prototype

This is a weekend project aimed at creating a **night vision helmet** to help miners in developing countries work more safely. 

For the prototype, we use:

- **Raspberry Pi Zero** as the main controller
- **LCD display** for visual output
- **Night vision camera** connected via a flex cable
- **Python script** for managing the shutdown button
- **Battery management circuit** to control charging and power using a single-cell battery

The goal of this prototype is to explore affordable night vision solutions with readily available hardware and simple electronics.
